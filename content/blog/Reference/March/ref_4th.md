- typescript 를 써서 간단한 생산성 툴을 만들어보고 싶던 차에 읽게 된 글
- 예전에 시도했었다가 새로운 스택들을 너무 많이 함께 사용했어서 마무리되지 못하고 흐지부지 끝내버린 경험이 있다. 이번에는 TS만의 장점을 느껴보고 싶다.

[35 Lessons from 35 Years of Newsletter Publishing](https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/35-lessons-from-35-years-of-newsletter-publishing)
- Perfection sucks and it’s boring.
- New idea? Just start. You can’t establish relationships if you’re not out there. Whatever it takes, get your idea out there now. Course correct, if and when needed. Every failure is possible entertainment for your audience. So, just ship.
- Inspiration is scheduled. It’s also called work. The common denominator of our tasks, projects, and entire lives is time. Your schedule is there to keep you consistent and sane. It’s the foundation of your process.
- Create daily. You don’t have to publish daily, but creation is the habit that makes everything else possible.
- Unlearn. Everything changes. It’s the only constant. Be ready to unlearn in an instant when presented with new information.

[I Didn't Think I Was Smart Enough](https://brittjoiner.hashnode.dev/i-didnt-think-i-was-smart-enough-cl11jy6p101aklgnv8k1h95g3)
- **Look at my list of wins and small things I've accomplished.** I write these down on a Trello board regularly and go back and check this list when I need encouragement.
- **Talk to my fellow programmers.** We all feel this way sometimes! Especially when I talk to my fellow women in tech, I realize we all feel this way and sometimes just knowing it's not just me helps.
- **Try something small.** Stuck on a big project? Go do a code review or pick a lighter task to get some momentum before tackling something larger.
- **Go look at all my projects. **Sometimes I'll look at my GitHub repo just to remember, yeah I built that, oh yeah I figured that out.
- **Think about something I did this week that I wouldn't have been able to do a year ago.** I reflect on regular tasks I do now that I would have needed help with this time last year, or even last month!
Take a walk. Get some perspective! Sometimes you just have to walk away and get some fresh air and it's okay—in fact, it's preferred!
- **Read inspirational quotes.** Yeah okay this is cheesy but it works.
- 최근에 많이 느꼈던 감정이기도 하고, 그 감정에서 벗어나는 방법에서도 많은 공감이 되었다. 매일 매일 넘어지고 일어나고 배우자!
